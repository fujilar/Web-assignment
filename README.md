I like it that it is challnenging and the moments to make things work out

I struggled alot with the project, not knowing where to start and how to built it correctly.
Even if i can some of things work out but i can fix what's next and make me feel like giving up.

i feel I should have try more hands on practice and revision more. I learn things very slow and have to keep make mistakes a lot of times before i learn.
